# Typescript Converter

The original vision of all of the converters were to be able to have them run in a lambda function, but what happens in practice usually lines up better than theory. Regardless of whether it was the typescript converter running in the lambda function or the C# converter I was met with the same issues (segmentation fault). The lambda function would crash when [converting](src/converter.ts) the buffer to a PDF document. Once I came across that issue working on the typescript converter, because I wasn't getting any type of error information with the .NET core app, I decided to create a [docker image](Dockerfile) instead in which I would be able to then deploy to AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) which could then be accessed either via the AWS SDK, a Lambda function to passthrough the stream, or from API gateway.
